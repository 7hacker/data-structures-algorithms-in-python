Wrangling with a Python

	 -- Just a bunch of katas with Python

	 -- Algorithms + data structures + whatever else the mind wants to play with

	 -- Some recursive code uses rcviz for visualization of a recursive tree - cool stuff! see the rcviz fork.

	 -- Some code uses non-standard libraries



10bit10mil.py : Given 10 million 10 bit ints, sort these efficiently

__init__.py : so Imports can work inside this directory

alt_pn.py : Take a list of positive and negative integers, and return a list with negative numbers on left and positive numbers on right while also mantaining the order of numbers in input list

array_product.py : for an input array [1,2,3] return back an array where each i is a product of elements before i and after i, excluding i. In this example the output is: [6, 3, 2]

binary_search.py : Binary Search!

bloomfilter.py : a bloom filter of /usr/share/dict/words

brackets.py : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/727707/finding-all-combinations-of-well-formed-brackets

cmd_example.py : How to build a Shell-esque Prompt interface using python

dict_editdistance.py : Edit distance dicitonary problem: given a dictionary of words : {cat, bat, hat, bad, had} and two strings a, b: a = bat, b = had how to convert a->b by changing only 1 char at a time

edit_distance_dynamic_rec.py : Edit distance using Dynamic programming

edit_distance_exhaustive_rec.py : Edit distance using Exhaustive Search

findMinInRotatedArray.py : 

graph_cycle.py : detect if a graph has a cycle or not

graph_dfs.py : graph dfs traversal

readmeGen.py : Built this README File
