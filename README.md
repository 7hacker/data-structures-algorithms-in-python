Wrangling with a Python

	 -- Just a bunch of katas with Python

	 -- Algorithms + data structures + whatever else the mind wants to play with

	 -- Some recursive code uses rcviz for visualization of a recursive tree - cool stuff! see the rcviz fork.

	 -- Some code uses non-standard libraries



10bit10mil.py : Given 10 million 10 bit ints, sort these efficiently
alt_pn.py : Take a list of positive and negative integers, and return a list with negative numbers on left and positive numbers on right while also mantaining the order of numbers in input list
array_product.py : for an input array [1,2,3] return back an array where each i is a product of elements before i and after i, excluding i. In this example the output is: [6, 3, 2]
bloomfilter.py : a bloom filter of /usr/share/dict/words
graph_cycle.py : detect if a graph has a cycle or not
graph_dfs.py : graph dfs traversal
readmeGen.py : Built this README File
