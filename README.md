Wrangling with a Python

	 -- Just a bunch of katas with Python

	 -- Algorithms + data structures + whatever else the mind wants to play with

	 -- Some recursive code uses rcviz for visualization of a recursive tree - cool stuff! see the rcviz fork.

	 -- Some code uses non-standard libraries



10bit10mil.py : Given 10 million 10 bit ints, sort these efficiently

__init__.py : so Imports can work inside this directory

alt_pn.py : Take a list of positive and negative integers, and return a list with negative numbers on left and positive numbers on right while also mantaining the order of numbers in input list

array_product.py : for an input array [1,2,3] return back an array where each i is a product of elements before i and after i, excluding i. In this example the output is: [6, 3, 2]

binary_search.py : Binary Search!

bloomfilter.py : a bloom filter of /usr/share/dict/words

brackets.py : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/727707/finding-all-combinations-of-well-formed-brackets

cmd_example.py : How to build a Shell-esque Prompt interface using python

coin.py : how many ways to make change of k, given a set of coins

coinplay.py : you and your friend are playing a game with coins, such that each coin has a value, and you can pick a coin from the start of a list or end of a list. If you begin first, and your friend is equally competent as you, what is the best choice you can make?

combinationSum.py :  Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T. The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.  All numbers (including target) will be positive integers. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations. For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, A solution set is: [[7], [2, 2, 3]]

countbits.py : count the bits set in a value n

dict_editdistance.py : Edit distance dicitonary problem: given a dictionary of words : {cat, bat, hat, bad, had} and two strings a, b: a = bat, b = had how to convert a->b by changing only 1 char at a time

edit_distance_dynamic_rec.py : Edit distance using Dynamic programming

edit_distance_exhaustive_rec.py : Edit distance using Exhaustive Search

exp_creator.py : Given some number eg n= 222 and k=24 and a set of operations: Join, Add, Multiply, verify if k can be formed by applying the operations on n. The combination of operatsion on N leads to : 222 (all joins), 2+22(Add, Join), 2*22(Multiple,Join), 22+2,22*2 and so on..

find_majority.py : Find the majority element in a list/array if the majority element appears atleast more than half the number of times

findMinInRotatedArray.py : Find the minimum element in a sorted array that has been rotated (rotated from the right end any number of times)

graph.py : Build your own graph using this Graph Library

graph_cycle.py : detect if a graph has a cycle or not

graph_dfs.py : graph dfs traversal

hanoi.py : tower of haoi

interleave.py : Given strings ab, cd and cadb, verify that cadb is an interleaved string of ab and cd. interleaved strings can be formed by choosing one element from each of the input strings, while mantaining the original order.cadb is a valid interleave, since the elements appear in the original order of the inputs ab and cd

isBST.py : Given a binary tree is it a Binary search tree?

linkedlist.py : Linked lists in Python using a Node abstraction

longestSubstring2chars.py : what is the size of Longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters eg: s = "eceba" output : 3 ("ece")

merge2arrs.py : Given 2 arrs: Short and Long of same size (n), that are already sorted return the sorted long array in linear time, merging the two arrays

minimumWindowSubstring.py : Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n). For example, S = "ADOBECODEBANC" T = "ABC" . Minimum window is "BANC".

minstack.py : implement a stack with the usual stack semantics but additionally also returns the Minimum value in the stack in O(1)

nextPalin.py : Given a number what is the immediate next Palindrome number? Example, given 135, output should be 141

numStairs_dyn_rec.py : How many ways can you climb N stairs, if you can take some [I, J, K...] steps? : Dynamic

numStairs_exhaustive.py : How many ways can you climb N stairs, if you can take some [I, J, K...] steps? : Exhaustive

pascal.py : Print out the pascal triangle for value: n

pow.py : Implement the pow function efficiently

printAllPathsTree.py : Given a binary tree, print out all of its root-to-leaf paths one per line

priorityQueue.py : A priority Queue

queue_using_doubly_linked.py : A queue using Linked list with forward and back pointers

queue_using_linkedlist.py : A Queue using Linked List style Nodes

queue_using_list.py : A Queue using Python Lists

readmeGen.py : Built this README File

regExMatcher.py : Build a regex Matcher for . (dot matches any single char) and * (asterix matches zero or more of the preceeding char). Given a string and a pattern(that contains dot and ansterix), output True or False if the string matches the pattern. Example : c*a*b matches aab and .* matches ab

revKlist.py : given a linked list and a value K, generate a linked list such that upto K elements are reversed. example for input 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and k=5 the output list is: 5,4,3,2,1,8,7,6

robber.py : What houses must a robber steal from, to get max value, if houses are indicated by value and adjacent houses cannot be stolen

rope_cut.py : cut a rope of size n such that the product of the cuts is maximized atleast one cut must be made example: rope of size = 4 the best cut is 2,2 (2 * 2 = 4) as opposed to 3,1 (3* 1 = 3) or 1,3 or 1,2,1, 2,1,1, 1,1,1,1

search_concatenatedWords.py : given T = dogthecatcatthedog and A = ["the", "cat"] (n words of k length) output 3, 9 since the concatenation thecat and catthe is found in T at those indices. all n words should be part of the concatenation pattern, each word is size k and order does not matter

segment_tree.py : A segment tree of Min values

snake.py : print a string sinusoidally

snake_ladder.py : snake & ladder game

stack.py : Get a stack by using this Lib

stringPermutations.py : Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string.  To start, assume every character in the input string is unique.

subsets.py : print all subsets of a given array/list

subtrees.py : what are the structurally unique binary trees that can be formed for size n?

swallow.py : Generate Numeronyms for a word upto size 2: Example: "nailed" can be compressed to n4d, na3d, n3ed, n2led, na2ed, nai2d

tree_postOrder_iterative.py : Given a binary tree, print the post-order traversal without using recursion

wildcard.py : Given a string of 0's, 1's and ?'s print out all the possible results where ?'s can be substituted for 0 or 1
